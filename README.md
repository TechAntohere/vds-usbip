# vDS (virtual DualSense)

[![Sponsor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-hurryman2212-ea4aaa?logo=githubsponsors&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/sponsors/hurryman2212)

## Purpose of this fork
This fork is dedicated to porting usbip as the default kernel driver for the Windows version of Vds.
It allows installation of the project without a restart aswell as removing the need of enabling test signing on windows as it removes the use of unsigned kernel drivers.
Other changes include the addition of the status widget reporting the live polling rate, headphone jack and microphone status aswell as the color of the controller.

Virtual USB-to-Bluetooth bridge for DualSense and DualSense Edge Wireless
Controllers. vDS currently supports all USB-based DualSense features over
Bluetooth (except firmware update), including quadraphonic haptic feedback
(vibration and speaker output), adaptive triggers, microphone input, and
headphone output; microphone and headphone support was added thanks to
[@TechAntohere](https://github.com/TechAntohere).

Through Linux `vds_hcd.ko` and Windows `vds_usb.sys` kernel drivers, vDS exposes
a Bluetooth-connected controller as a virtual USB DualSense-class device so
games and applications can use features normally available only over USB. The
common userspace daemon `vdsd` translates the virtual USB traffic to and from
the physical controller's Bluetooth protocol.

Detailed DualSense output and haptics packet handling is based on
[DS5Dongle](https://github.com/awalol/DS5Dongle) and protocol capture research.
In theory, other physical gamepad controllers could be implemented as vDS
backends and attached to vDS, as long as they can provide the DualSense-specific
features required by games. The vDS infrastructure could also be extended to
support physical transports other than Bluetooth.

## Manual Build Guides

- [Linux](README-LINUX.md)
- [Windows](README-WINDOWS.md)

## Common Controller Configuration

`vdsctl attach` registers paired physical Bluetooth controllers in `vdsd.db`.
The same command format and JSONL database format are used on Linux and Windows.
Use `vdsctl list-targets` to list paired attachable Bluetooth controllers and
their addresses.

```sh
vdsctl list-targets
vdsctl attach aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01 --profile ds5 --ports 0 # Connect as DualSense
vdsctl attach aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02 --profile dse --ports 1 # Connect as DualSense Edge
vdsctl detach aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02 # Detach aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02
vdsctl list # Show registered controllers
```

Omit `--ports` or pass `--ports ""` to allow all configured ports. Omit
`--profile` or pass `--profile ""` to use the physical controller profile.

> [!TIP]
>
> `--profile` can expose a controller as a different controller type than the
> physical device. This can be useful when an application supports DualSense but
> not DualSense Edge, or the other way around.

```jsonl
{"address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:01","profile":"","ports":[]}
{"address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:02","profile":"dse","ports":[1]}
```

`--ports 0,2` maps to `/dev/vds0,/dev/vds2` on Linux and `\\.\vds0,\\.\vds2` on
Windows.

## Reporting Issues

When reporting an issue, include the platform, vDS version, controller model,
connection type (e.g. your bluetooth adapter's model name), affected application
or game, and reproduction steps.

For runtime problems, enable tracing before reproducing the issue, then turn it
off afterwards:

```sh
vdsctl trace on --scope all
vdsctl trace off --scope all
```

You can check or attach the `vdsd` log from:

```text
Linux:   /var/log/vdsd.log
Windows: C:\ProgramData\vDS\vdsd.log
```
